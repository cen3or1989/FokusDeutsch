# Project Restoration Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Backend Server Not Running
**Problem**: The Flask backend server could not start due to missing DATABASE_URL environment variable.

**Solution**: 
- Created `.env` file with necessary environment variables
- Modified `src/main.py` to support both PostgreSQL and SQLite databases
- Set up SQLite database for development/testing

### 2. Database Tables Missing
**Problem**: Database tables were not created, causing "no such table: exam" errors.

**Solution**:
- Created database tables using SQLAlchemy's `db.create_all()`
- Added a test exam with proper JSON data structure

### 3. No Tests Available
**Problem**: The project had no test configuration, causing "no tests can be loaded" error.

**Solution**:
- Installed testing dependencies: `vitest`, `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/jest-dom`, `jsdom`
- Created `vitest.config.js` configuration file
- Added test setup file at `src/__tests__/setup.js`
- Created sample test for ErrorBoundary component
- Added test scripts to `package.json`

### 4. "Etwas ist schiefgelaufen" Error
**Problem**: Error boundary was triggered when clicking on exams due to backend API failures.

**Solution**:
- Fixed backend connectivity issues
- Ensured proper database setup
- Created test data to verify API endpoints

## Current Status

✅ **Backend**: Running on http://localhost:5000
- Database: SQLite (test_database.db)
- API endpoints working correctly
- Health check: `/api/health` returns "healthy"

✅ **Frontend**: Running on http://localhost:5173
- React development server active
- Error boundary properly implemented
- Test suite configured and passing

✅ **Tests**: 2/2 passing
- ErrorBoundary component tests working
- Vitest configuration complete

## Test Results

```bash
$ npm run test:run
✓ src/components/__tests__/ErrorBoundary.test.jsx (2 tests) 47ms
  ✓ ErrorBoundary > should render children when there is no error 16ms
  ✓ ErrorBoundary > should render error message when there is an error 30ms

Test Files  1 passed (1)
     Tests  2 passed (2)
```

## API Verification

- `/api/health` - ✅ Healthy
- `/api/exams` - ✅ Returns exam list
- `/api/exams/1` - ✅ Returns specific exam data

## Next Steps

1. Test the frontend application by navigating to http://localhost:5173
2. Click on the test exam to verify the error is resolved
3. Add more comprehensive test coverage as needed
4. Consider adding more sample exam data for testing

## Environment Configuration

The project now includes a `.env` file with:
- `DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///test_database.db`
- `SECRET_KEY=dev-secret-key-change-in-production`
- `DEBUG=true`
- `HOST=0.0.0.0`
- `PORT=5000`
- `FRONTEND_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173`
